<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">all the canals at Jouy-le-Vicomte, which is <em>Gaudiacus vicecomitis</em>, as of course you know. Each time that I have been to Jouy I have seen a bit of a canal in one place, and then I have turned a corner and seen another, but when I saw the second I could no longer see the first. I tried in vain to imagine how they lay by one another; it was no good. But, from the top of Saint-Hilaire, it's quite another matter; the whole countryside is spread out before you like a map. Only, you cannot make out the water; you would say that there were great rifts in the town, slicing it up so neatly that it looks like a loaf of bread which still holds together after it has been cut up. To get it all quite perfect you would have to be in both places at once; up here on the top of Saint-Hilaire and down there at Jouy-le-Vicomte."</p><p>The Curï¿½ had so much exhausted my aunt that no sooner had he gone than she was obliged to send away Eulalie also.</p></div> </div>
